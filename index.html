							I'm a doctoral student in Computer Science at the <a href="http://www.ic.gatech.edu/">School of Interactive Computing</a> at Georgia Institute of Technology. I work in the Social Dynamics and Wellbeing lab and am advised by <a href="http://www.munmund.net/">Munmun De Choudhury</a>. Previously, I was at International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad, India where I completed my undergraduate and graduate studies (majoring in Computer Science with a research specialization in Humanities).<br /> <br/> 
My research interests are in Computational Social Science (Social Computing) wherein I am interested in studying human behavior as manifested on online social media platforms. My research explores statistical machine learning, natural language processing and social network analysis methods to analyze large scale social media data to derive insights specific to mental health and wellbeing. In one line of research, I am studying how social media platforms facilitate behaviors around stigmatizing mental health challenges through self-disclosure, social support and social capital. In another line of research, I am developing computational methods to study how behaviors on social media in clinical populations can be used to inform psychiatric interventions through early identification of risk markers and predicting adverse outcomes such as a relapse episode.

<!-- Prior to Tech, I was at International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad, India where I completed my undergraduate and graduate studies (majoring in Computer Science with a research specialization in Computational Humanities). A lot of my work from back then was around user modeling, personality mining and ontology engineering. Outside academia (is there really an outside?), I am a Grade 3 violinist and I love cooking and traveling.-->

I am interested in interdisciplinary, collaborative research at the intersection of Social Science and Computing. My research interests primarily lie in Social Computing (Computational Social Science), Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. A lot of my work focuses on using quantitative methods to study human behavior and social phenomena on the internet. I am currently part of the Social Dynamics and Wellbeing lab at Georgia Tech, where I am advised by Prof. Munmun De Choudhury. At present, we are working on examining behavioral and linguistic markers leading to social media disclosures on stigmatized mental health concerns such as Schizophrenia to characterize wellbeing.  -->

							May 2017 - I am excited to join the Machine Intelligence and Data Science (MINDS) group at the University of Southern Californiaâ€˜s Information Sciences Institute to work with Prof. Emilio Ferrara. I will be working on forecasting evolving cyber threats using novel, unconventional data sensors.
